# bank_churn_rate_prediction
**The goal is to help analysts predict the churn rate of these customers in order to reduce it**

The database includes demographic information such as age, gender, marital status, and income category. It also contains information on the type of card, the number of months in the portfolio and the inactive periods. In addition, it has key data on the spending behavior of customers who are approaching their decision to cancel. Among this last information there is the total revolving balance, the credit limit, the average opening rate for the purchase and analyzable metrics such as the total amount of the change from the fourth quarter to the first or the average utilization rate.

With this data set we can capture up-to-date information that can determine the long-term stability of the account or its imminent exit.

**Objective**: Create a predictive classification model to be able to classify the data

**The XGBClassifier() model is applied with a RandomizedSearchCV().**
